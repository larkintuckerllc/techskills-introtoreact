subtitle: Intro to React

-----------------------------------------------

Outline:

  - [_Question_:] I often hear about builds and webpack in conjunction with React, what is that about?
  - Transition to a build (compile) process is a big change
    - Most historical JavaScript, like reference, are human readable files
    - At some time building has been around for specialty purposes
      - Tools
        - Grunt
        - Gulp
        - Less
        - Sass
        - webpack (under hood of CRA)
      - Purposes
        - CSS short-cuts, variables
        - CSS autoprefixing
        - JavaScript minifying
        - JavaScript bundling
  - Looking at CRA build output
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Production build vs development
      - Execute
        - Working directory
          - reference-cra
        - Command
          - yarn build
    - [_Cue_:]
      - The output
      - Execute
        - Working directory
          - reference-cra/build
        - Command
          - ls
    - Ignore both asset-manifest.json and service-worker.js
      - Used with advanced offline caching techniques
    - [_Cue_:]
      - HTML file with injected <script> tag
      - Editor
        - reference-cra/build/index.html
    - [_Cue_:]
      - minimized JavaScript; oddly large
      - Editor
        - reference-cra/build/static/js/main.a38c6114.js
    - [_Cue_:]
      - The map file is used for debugging
      - Execute
        - Working directory
          - reference-cra/build/static/js
        - Command
          - ls
  - [_Question_:] How do exactly deploy my application to production?
  - Copy contents of dist folder to a web server and access index.html in browser.
  - require: A modern practice, break up JavaScript into small modular files.
    - Modules have their own variable scope (or closure)
    - Modules export their functionality by assigning a value to module.exports.
    - Modules import functionality from other modules using the require function.          
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Exporting a function
      - Editor
        - require/src/hello.js
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Importing a function
      - Editor
        - require/src/index.js
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Observing result
      - Execute
        - Working directory
          - require
        - Command
          - yarn start
  - folder: You can also require a folder
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Key is the file name, index.js (or index.jsx - later)
      - Execute
        - Working directory
          - folder/src/hello
        - Command
          - ls
  - [_Question_:] I see how you require your own modules; how about requiring third-party code?
  - package: Requiring third-party code
    - Node Package Manager (npm) packages
    - Can use npm command
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Can also use yarn; faster and more precise version control
      - Execute
        - Working directory
          - package
        - Command
          - yarn add sillyname (DON'T DO - SLOW)
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Keep track of project dependencies
      - Editor
        - package/package.json
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Using a package
      - Editor
        - package/src/index.js
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Observing result
      - Execute
        - Working directory
          - package
        - Command
          - yarn start
  - css: bringing in CSS
    - [_Question_:] CSS? I normally just add CSS links to my HTML file.
    - simply require it
    - production build creates a single combined CSS file
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Regular CSS file
      - Editor
        - css/src/index.css
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Importing CSS
      - Editor
        - require/src/index.js
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Observing result
      - Execute
        - Working directory
          - css
        - Command
          - yarn start
  - images: bringing in images
    - Like CSS, just require it
    - production build may store in build/static/media on in the JS bundle
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Add image to the src directory
      - Execute
        - Working directory
          - images/src
        - Command
          - ls
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Creating image tag - this is a pain
      - Editor
        - public/index.html
    - [_Cue_:]
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Importing Image
      - Editor
        - images/src/index.js
    - [_Cue_:]
      - Observing result
      - Execute

          - images
        - Command
          - yarn start        
  - [_Question_:] So are we ready to learn React now?
  - In the next episode we will introduce the modern ES2015 JavaScript.
