Outline:

  - [_Question_:] I have heard a lot about the React JavaScript library lately. What is it and what is it used for?
  - What is React?
    - "A JavaScript library for building user interfaces" -- Facebook
      - Application that runs in the web browser
      - Rendering and event management
    - Built by Facebook
      - Solving problems with growing application complexity
      - Release as an open source project
      - Many core contributors now work on a dedicated React team at Facebook
    - Key features
      - Focused: Keep React itself simple; leaving rest to community
      - Tested: Because of thousands of applications depend on it
      - Stable: Changing thousands of applications is a non-starter
    - [_Question_:] What do you need to get started with React?
    - Knowledge Prerequisites
      - Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
      - Assumption; coming from (or familiar with) a jQuery style application.
    - Hardware / Software Prerequisites
      - Computer / OS: Windows, macOS, or Linux
      - Chrome Browser: Primarily because of development tools
      - Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for computer; not browser
